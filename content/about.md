### Hello! 

I am Mukund Kedia.

I have major experience is in Web and API pentesting, along with basic knowledge of Thick Client and Network pentesting too. My work has also included source code reviews, server configuration reviews, and compliance assessments such as data localization audit.

I’m continuously improving my skills in source code review and have a strong interest in reverse engineering and low-level programming.

I have experience with Python, Node.js, and Bash, and I’m looking to further strengthen my overall coding proficiency.

I have got some Holopin [badges](https://www.holopin.io/@devplayer55221#badges).
